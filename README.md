The Good Fight of Faith (Online)

"The Good Fight of Faith" (GFF) is a Christian, Bible-based computer game where the player takes the role of a new believer, guiding him through an allegorical world to learn the books of the Bible, evangelize the lost, and conquer spiritual strongholds, en route to a final showdown with Satan, the tempter of man and accuser of the brethren. GFF is a procedurally-generated RPG/adventure game that features a number of Bible-based minigames, most notably a "scripture battle" to combat the forces of spiritual darkness that oppose God's plan of salvation for man.

I first worked on GFF in 2013, originally in Java, but it was never completed for various reasons. In August 2024, I was re-inspired to create and finish the project, this time as an online game written in Typescript. I decided to use Phaser, a popular game framework for developing games in Javascript and Typescript.

Character graphics with created using 8D Character Creator (https://robertpinero.itch.io/8dchars). Many other graphics are AI-generated using apps like Remix: AI Image Generator (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remix-ai-image-generator/id6451186853).

Monthly updates are published to the game's current public version, temporarily hosted at:
