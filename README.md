The Good Fight of Faith (Online)

"The Good Fight of Faith" (GFF) is a Christian, Bible-based computer game that helps the player learn the contents of the holy scritpures, the fundamental principles of Christianity, and the spiritual realities of the Christian life. You take the role of a new believer, "Adam Cesar" (my best friend in real life), guiding him through an allegorical world to learn the books of the Bible, evangelize the lost, and conquer spiritual strongholds, en route to a final showdown with Satan, the tempter of man and accuser of the brethren. GFF is a procedurally-generated RPG/adventure game that features world exploration, item collection, and a number of Bible-based minigames, most notably a "scripture battle" to combat the forces of spiritual darkness that oppose God's plan of salvation for man.

I first worked on GFF in 2013, originally in Java, but it was never completed for various reasons. In August 2024, I was re-inspired to create and finish the project, this time as an online game written in Typescript. I decided to use Phaser, a popular game framework for developing games in Javascript and Typescript.

Character graphics were created using 8D Character Creator (https://robertpinero.itch.io/8dchars).
Many other graphics are AI-generated using apps like Remix: AI Image Generator (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/remix-ai-image-generator/id6451186853).

Monthly updates are published to the game's current public version, temporarily hosted at:
