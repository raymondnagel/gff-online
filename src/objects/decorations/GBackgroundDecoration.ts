/**
 * GBackgroundDecoration is an image that gets rendered directly over
 * the room background, without creating and managing a game
 * object. It doesn't need to be subclassed, because it has
 * no special features or interactions; it's only purpose is
 * to decorate the background.
 *
 * Background decoration images should be flat on the ground (not tall),
 * or at least nearly flat (short), like the shrine pedestal.
 *
 * Examples include a flower patch, carpet, or other visual
 * elements that can be walked over with no consequence.
 *
 * Background decorations ALWAYS appear behind the player.
