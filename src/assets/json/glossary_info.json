Adam is not only a good friend to me, but a faithful servant and minister of Jesus Christ."

      "text": "Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. (...) By faith, Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.\" (Hebrews 11:1, 7)",
      "image": "cross",
      "inspiration": "Faith is one of the central themes of Christianity. Faith is believing in what is not seen, on the basis of what is revealed; it is the only way for us to have a relationship with the invisible God, who reveals himself by his Word. (1 Sam. 3:21; Col. 1:15; John 1:1-18) It is through faith that Christ dwells in our hearts (Eph. 3:17); it is the way of God's righteousness (Rom. 1:17; 10:10; Phil. 3:9); and it is the means by which we have access into God's grace (Rom. 5:1-2), the only thing that can save us (Eph. 2:8)."

      "inspiration": "God's grace is his favor, kindness, and goodwill toward man, and specially toward those who are righteous before him (Gen. 6:8-9; 7:1). It is God being \"for us\" (Rom. 8:31), shewing himself strong on our behalf (2 Chron. 16:9). The scripture says that God's grace is accessed by faith (Rom. 5:2); that we must grow in it (2 Pet. 3:18); and that he gives grace to those who walk in humility and uprightness (Mic. 6:8; Jas. 4:6; Ps. 84:11). There is no greater power, or more precious gift, than the true grace of God in Jesus Christ."

With Christ as the head (Eph. 1:22; 5:23; Col. 1:18), the church is called to be his body, carrying on the ministry of reconciliation upon the earth in his stead (2 Cor. 5:18-20)."

It is through prayer that we talk to our Father, expressing our worship, needs, desires, concerns, and thanks; and we have confidence that he hears us, cares for us, and answers for our good according to his will. (1 John 5:14-15.) In GFF, Adam can use the 'Pray' ability to find grace in time of need, building up his most holy faith as he prays in the Holy Ghost (Heb. 4:16; Jude 1:20)."
