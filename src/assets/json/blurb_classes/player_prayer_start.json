    "Give ear to my words, O LORD; consider my meditation.",
    "Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.",
    "Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.",
    "Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.",
    "Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.",
    "Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.",
    "Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.",
    "Hear me speedily, O LORD; my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit."
