    "Thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth!",
    "Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon HEARER_SAINT: LORD, be thou his helper.",
    "O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever!",
    "Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?"
