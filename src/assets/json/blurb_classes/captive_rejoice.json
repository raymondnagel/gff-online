    "Thank you, O Lord! For great is thy mercy toward me, and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell!",
    "Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in mercy delivered it from the pit of corruption: for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back!",
    "Now, being made free from sin, I am become a servant of God and of righteousness; may my fruit be henceforth unto holiness, and the end everlasting life!",
    "O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever! Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy!",
    "Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron... Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses!"
