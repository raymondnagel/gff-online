    "May the Lord find me faithful. Amen.",
    "Thank you, faithful brethren.",
    "Let me find grace in the eyes of the Lord.",
    "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.",
    "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.",
    "Surely I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living."
