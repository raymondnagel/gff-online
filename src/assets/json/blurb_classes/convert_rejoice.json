    "Hallelujah! This is the best day of my life!",
    "I am so glad that Jesus loves me! Jesus loves me! Jesus loves even ME!",
    "The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation!",
    "I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation!",
    "Glory to God in the highest! And on earth peace... finally, peace in my heart!",
    "I've passed from death unto life in Christ! Alleluia!",
    "Abba, Father! What a blessed Spirit of adoption is this!",
    "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour!",
    "O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth forever!",
    "I was lost, but now I'm found! I was blind, but now I see! I was dead, but now I'm alive!",
    "Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high, who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!"
