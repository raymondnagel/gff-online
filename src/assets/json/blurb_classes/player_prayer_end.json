    "My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.",
    "Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.",
    "Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.",
    "Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.",
    "Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.",
    "For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.",
    "Be merciful unto me, O LORD; for I cry unto thee daily.",
    "Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me."
