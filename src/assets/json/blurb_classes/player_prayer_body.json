    "Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.",
    "My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?",
    "Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.",
    "When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.",
    "Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.",
    "From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.",
    "Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.",
    "Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee."
