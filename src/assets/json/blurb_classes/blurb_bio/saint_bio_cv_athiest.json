    "I knew that there must be more to life than what I could see; and when I heard the word of God, I finally understood.",
    "When I finally heard the gospel, I couldn't believe that Christ would die for me. His love is what changed my life!",
    "In my darkest hour, he sent a preacher to me who revealed the thoughts of my heart, and gave me hope in the gospel.",
    "Even though I was an atheist, I was afraid to die. I knew deep inside that I was a sinner, and I had to make peace with God before it was too late."
