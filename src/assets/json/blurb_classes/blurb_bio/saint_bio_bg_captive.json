    "I started out on the wrong path in life. I was a servant to sin, and it was a hard master.",
    "All my life, I just wanted to have fun and do the things that made me feel good. I was a slave to my own lusts.",
    "I used to think that serving God would take away all my freedom. I didn't know that I was already a servant... to sin.",
    "For so long, I was trapped in darkness, and I didn't even realize it. But then, one day, I wanted to escape, and I couldn't."
