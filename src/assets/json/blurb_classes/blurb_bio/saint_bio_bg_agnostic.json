    "Growing up, I heard a lot of stories about God, but I never really believed them.",
    "I always wondered if God was really out there.",
    "People told me that there was a God; but I couldn't see him, so I didn't believe.",
    "When I was growing up, I heard about lots of different religions and gods. I didn't know what to believe."
