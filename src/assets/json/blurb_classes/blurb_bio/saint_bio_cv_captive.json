    "But then I cried out to God for help, and he heard my voice! He sent you, dear brother, to loose my bonds!",

    "Then one day, you came with the word of God, and proclaimed liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that were bound!",
    "But then the Lord heard me in a time accepted, and succoured me in the day of salvation, sending you to rescue me!"
