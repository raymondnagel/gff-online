    "But the Lord was gracious to me, and opened my eyes to the truth.",
    "But God was merciful to my unrighteousness, and succored me in the day of salvation.",
    "But God was rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved me.",
    "But God commended his love toward me while I was yet a sinner."
