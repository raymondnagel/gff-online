    "One day, as I was reading the Bible, God opened my eyes to the truth: I needed God, not just empty religious practices.",
    "God showed me that I needed to be found in Christ, not just in a church.",
    "The Lord sent a friend to me who was a true believer, and he helped me to understand the gospel: that only in Christ could I be acceptable to God.",
    "As I read the words of Jesus, I realized that only the outside of my cup was clean, and the inside was still filthy. I needed to be cleansed from the inside out."
