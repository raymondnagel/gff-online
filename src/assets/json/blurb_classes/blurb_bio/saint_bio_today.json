    "By God's wonderful grace, I'm now a disciple of Christ and a child of God. Glory to his name!",
    "Now I'm walking in newness of life, serving the Lord with all my heart.",
    "Today, I stand before you as a testimony of God's grace and mercy. He is so good!",
    "And now, I walk in the light, as he is in the light; and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth me from all sin."
