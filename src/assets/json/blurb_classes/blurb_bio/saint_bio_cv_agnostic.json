    "When I called out to God, I didn't know if he even existed. But he did, and he heard me; and by his gospel, he spoke to me.",
    "For so long, I wasn't sure God was even real. But as I learned about Jesus, I began to see that he wasn't just another man.",
    "When I finally started reading the Bible... it just hit me: this is the truth! It's the greatest truth in the world!",
    "What finally convinced me that God is real was when I saw him working in the lives Christians. And then... I wanted what they had. I wanted to know God, too!"
