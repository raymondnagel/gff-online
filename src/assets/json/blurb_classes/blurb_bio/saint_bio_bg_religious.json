    "My family was very religious, but I didn't truly know the Lord.",
    "I believed in God, but I didn't have a real relationship with him. I didn't know Christ.",
    "Our family went to church every Sunday, but I didn't really understand what it meant to have a relationship with God.",
    "I was taught to say a prayer when I was a little child, but I had no idea what it meant to walk with God."
