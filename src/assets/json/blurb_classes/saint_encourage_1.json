    "The Lord loves you, brother!",
    "He will never leave thee, nor forsake thee!",
    "Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.",
    "The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy."
